Basic SpiNNaker network testbed
===============================


Development Platform
--------------------

This software is based on the SpiNNaker Graph-Front-End (GFE) platform.
The GFE must be installed to use this software. For further information
about the GFE see:

[GFE introduction](http://spinnakermanchester.github.io/graph_front_end/5.0.0/index.html)

[GFE github repository](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/SpiNNakerGraphFrontEnd)

As with most SpiNNaker software, this repository contains C code --that
runs on SpiNNaker-- which implements the actual neural network, and python
code --that runs on the host machine-- which manages the distribution of
tasks across SpiNNaker cores and sets up the communications network
to support inter-core communication. This code is also responsible for
the downloading of data to SpiNNaker and the collection of results.
